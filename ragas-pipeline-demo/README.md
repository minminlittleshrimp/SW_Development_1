# RAGAS Pipeline Demo

This project demonstrates the use of RAGAS (Robust Automated Generalized Analysis System) for running a data processing and machine learning pipeline. The pipeline is designed to load a sample dataset, preprocess the data, and perform model training and evaluation.

### Files Overview

- **data/example_dataset.csv**: Contains a sample dataset with columns `id`, `feature1`, `feature2`, and `label` used for the RAGAS pipeline demo.
  
- **src/pipeline.py**: The main logic for running the RAGAS pipeline, including data loading, processing, and model training/evaluation.

- **src/utils.py**: Utility functions for data manipulation and processing, including functions for loading and preprocessing data.

- **src/__init__.py**: Marks the `src` directory as a package and can be used for importing key functions from other modules.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and any specific RAGAS library.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ragas-pipeline-demo
   ```

2. Set up your environment and install the required packages:
   ```
   python setup_env.py
   ```

### Running the Demo

To run the RAGAS pipeline demo, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python src/pipeline.py
```

This will load the example dataset, preprocess the data, and run the model training and evaluation steps.
